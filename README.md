# Covid-temperature-machine
Hello,
I have created a project which is specifically for temperature-based entrance system.
1. It basically measures body temperature.
2. Take decisions on the basis of temperature value.
3. Opens the door when it is normal.
4. Door will remain closed when the temperature is high.
5. No temperature sensation if there isn't any person available.

tools used:
Arduino uno
